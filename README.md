<!-- Customer Quote -->
"My Gas Log keeps a history of my gas spending and my car's current MPG. When I moved across the Bay, I saw that my MPG went down since traffic is heavier, and I realized that if I wanted to spend less money on gas I would have to drive more efficiently or get a more efficient vehicle."
